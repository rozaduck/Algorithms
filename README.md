* Mergesort 
* Binary Search Tree 

### Wordsort 
Takes a text file input and sorts, word-by-word, into a Binary Search Tree. The freqency of words is recorded in this process. The array in which the BST is stored is then sorted by freqency using a mergesort. The ten most and least frequent words are then displayed. 
This results in data that is simultaneously sorted alphabetically (in a BST) and by frequency (as an array).
